Advanced Mobile Price Detection Pipeline
------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
-----------
The Advanced Mobile Price Detection Pipeline is an end-to-end solution designed to collect, preprocess, analyze, and predict mobile phone prices. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models alongside advanced visualization techniques to provide insightful analytics and actionable predictions. The pipeline covers mobile devices released from the year 2000 onward.

Key Objectives:
• Automate data collection (or utilize predefined datasets) for mobile phone specifications.
• Engineer relevant features such as device age, RAM, storage, camera quality, and screen size.
• Train multiple predictive models (TabNet, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with hyperparameter tuning.
• Visualize data using over 20 interactive and 3D charts for deep insights.
• Enhance model interpretability with SHAP.
• Prepare trained artifacts for deployment in production environments.

------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:
----------------
1. Clone the repository:
   > git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-mobile-price-detection.git
   > cd advanced-mobile-price-detection

2. Install the required Python packages:
   > pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure that your environment has up-to-date versions of Plotly, Seaborn, Optuna, and other dependencies.

------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
-------
The pipeline is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook located in the "src" folder. To run the full workflow:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   > jupyter notebook src/pipeline.ipynb

2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially. The notebook covers:
   - Data collection (or loading a synthetic dataset if no external source is available)
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model training and evaluation across multiple algorithms
   - Generation of 22 distinct and interactive visualizations
   - Model explainability using SHAP
   - Saving of trained models and scalers for future deployment

------------------------------------------------------------
Visualizations & Analysis:
----------------------------
The pipeline provides a suite of over 20 advanced graphs to explore the dataset and model performance. Some key visualizations include:

1. 3D Scatter Plot – Age vs. RAM vs. Price
   (See images/graph1.png)
   • Interactive 3D plot showing the relationship between device age, RAM, and price. Marker sizes indicate storage capacity and colors represent different brands.

2. 3D Scatter Plot – Storage vs. Screen Size vs. Price
   (See images/graph2.png)
   • Visualizes the interplay between storage, screen size, and price with brand differentiation.

3. Correlation Heatmap
   (See images/graph3.png)
   • Displays the correlation matrix for numerical features like age, RAM, storage, camera quality, screen size, and price.

4. Radar Chart – Average Features for a Specific Brand (e.g., Apple)
   (See images/graph14.png)
   • Compares average specifications for a chosen brand, offering insights into the performance and market positioning of devices.

Additional charts include box plots, histograms, density plots, scatter matrices, parallel coordinate plots, contour plots, and a 3D surface plot to illustrate the price landscape.

------------------------------------------------------------
Results:
---------
The pipeline delivers competitive price predictions by leveraging multiple models. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 score are computed to compare model performance. Detailed results are available within the pipeline notebook, highlighting each model's strengths and suitability for different datasets.
