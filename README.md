ADVANCED MOBILE PRICE DETECTION PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
-----------
The Advanced Mobile Price Detection Pipeline is an end-to-end solution for collecting, processing, analyzing, and predicting mobile phone prices. This project covers mobile devices released from the year 2000 onward and uses state-of-the-art machine learning (including TabNet, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and deep learning techniques, advanced hyperparameter tuning (with Optuna), interactive visualizations (using Plotly and Seaborn), and model interpretability via SHAP. The pipeline is designed for researchers and practitioners looking to gain deep insights into mobile pricing dynamics.

Key Objectives:
• Automate data collection (via APIs or synthetic generation) of mobile phone specifications.
• Engineer features such as device age, RAM, storage, camera quality, and screen size.
• Train multiple predictive models with hyperparameter tuning.
• Produce over 20 interactive and analytical visualizations, including 3D plots and heatmaps.
• Explain model predictions using SHAP.
• Save trained models and scalers for production deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:
---------------
1. Clone the Repository:
   Open your terminal and run:
   
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-mobile-price-detection.git
       cd advanced-mobile-price-detection

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed.
   Then run:
   
       pip install -r requirements.txt

   (Make sure that your environment includes updated versions of Plotly, Seaborn, Optuna, SHAP, and other dependencies.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
-------
The full pipeline is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook located at "src/pipeline.ipynb". To run the complete workflow:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook from the repository’s root directory:
   
       jupyter notebook src/pipeline.ipynb

2. Execute all the notebook cells sequentially. The notebook covers:
   • Data collection or synthetic data generation.
   • Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
   • Training multiple models with evaluation.
   • Generating over 20 interactive visualizations.
   • Model explainability with SHAP.
   • Saving trained artifacts for deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------
Visualizations & Analysis:
----------------------------
This pipeline provides a rich set of interactive graphs. Examples include:

1. 3D Scatter Plots:
   - "download.png" and "download (1).png": 3D scatter plot showing the relationship between device age, RAM, and price. Marker sizes indicate storage, while colors represent different brands.
   - "download (2).png": 3D scatter plot visualizing storage versus screen size versus price.

2. Correlation & Statistical Charts:
   - "newplot.png": Correlation heatmap among key numerical features.
   - "newplot (1).png", "newplot (2).png", "newplot (3).png": Box plots, histograms, and density plots illustrating the distribution of mobile prices.

3. Advanced Comparative Visualizations:
   - "newplot (4).png" and "newplot (5).png": Radar charts comparing average features for a selected brand (e.g., Apple).
   - "newplot (6).png" to "newplot (17).png: A variety of additional plots including scatter matrices, parallel coordinate plots, contour plots, and 3D surface plots that explore feature relationships and the price landscape.

Each image file in the "images" folder corresponds to a specific visualization produced by the pipeline. These images are referenced in this README using relative paths (e.g., images/download.png).

------------------------------------------------------------
Ensuring Images Display Correctly:
------------------------------------------------------------
• Create an "images" folder in the root directory of your repository.
• Place all the above image files in that folder.
• Verify that your .gitignore file does not exclude the "images" folder.
• When you commit and push your repository to GitHub, the images will automatically appear in the README and repository view.
• In the README, reference each image with its relative path (for example, "images/download.png") so that GitHub can render them properly.

------------------------------------------------------------
Results:
---------
The pipeline delivers robust mobile price predictions with competitive evaluation metrics (such as MAE and R2 score). Detailed model performance, diagnostics, and interactive visualization outputs are available in the pipeline notebook, providing insights into feature importance and model behavior.
